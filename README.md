# Lyt

**A privacy-focused web browser for Windows, built on Chromium.**
Pronounced "light". *Your browser. Your business.*

> **Status: early development.** Lyt is an experimental alpha being built now. There is no public download yet. This page shows what is being made; it is not the source code.

## What Lyt is

Lyt is a native desktop browser, a real fork of current Chromium rather than a skin over another browser. It aims to be private by default without needing hours of setup, while keeping the website compatibility and extension support people expect from a Chromium browser.

## Planned for the first alpha

- **Full uBlock Origin, built in.** The complete uBlock Origin, not the "Lite" version, ready from first launch, with its dashboard and element picker.
- **Privacy Badger, built in.** EFF's tracker-learning blocker sits alongside uBlock Origin, handling trackers that filter lists miss.
- **Private defaults.** Third-party cookies blocked. No search-as-you-type sent to a search engine. No speculative page preloading. No usage telemetry. No account required.
- **Memory Saver on by default.** Idle tabs release memory and reload when you return to them. You choose how aggressive it is and which sites are exempt.
- **A compact, dark interface.** A slim tab strip and toolbar that give the page more of the screen.
- **Your extensions.** Chrome Web Store extensions are supported, and popular ones are tested individually.

## Further out

- **Lyt Shield:** one place to see and control what each site can do (cookies and storage, fingerprinting protection, "forget this site", and temporary fixes for broken sites).
- Stronger protection against cross-site tracking and fingerprinting, guided by measurement rather than marketing claims.
- An installer with signed, verified updates.

## Principles

- **Honest claims.** Lyt will only claim the protections it has tested, and will say what it does not protect against.
- **Security first.** Chromium's sandbox, site isolation and certificate checks stay intact. Privacy is never bought by weakening security.
- **Local first.** No browsing data leaves your device for Lyt's benefit.
